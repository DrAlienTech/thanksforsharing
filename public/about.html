                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>ThanksForSharing is a website that is used explicitly for school stores. Students can create accounts and easily purchase products ranging from general school supplies to products for specific clubs. This particular site is linked to South Forsyth High School located in Cumming, Georgia.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="section">
                    <h1>Directions of Use</h1>
                    <p>Once a student creates an account, they are given a dashboard. Here they can access important parts of the site such as announcements from teachers, new products that teachers have added and recommended products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Students also have access to a side menu on the dashboard. Here the student can gain access to account settings and their groups. A group can be something such as a class or a club. It has a teacher who can add students to the group. 
                        On here, the teacher can post new products specific to the group that students can have access to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another important aspect that differentiates ThanksForSharing from other online school stores is the fact that both students and teachers can sell or rent past supplies to students.
                        Both students and teachers can access this feature by clicking on the My Products section of the side menu. For teachers, they can choose a particular group that they want to add a product to. Students have a similar feature called S2S, which stand for Student to Student.
                        Here, students can sell or rent out products to other students. However, they do not choose a specific class and their products are accessible to everyone. Once either a teacher or student has posted a product,
                        they will get requests. Once the product has been given to the buyer, the seller must mark the request as completed to prevent buyers from purchasing products more than once without paying.
                    </p>

                            The image shown is a customer-to-customer (S2S) icon. You will see it in many products when you are shopping through our vast collection.
                            These are products that other customers are renting out through our

                    <h3>What is S2S verification?</h3>
                    <p>
                        "S2S Verified" means that you have purchased at least USD $500 on our site with your account.
                        After this threshold has been crossed, you will be given access to the S2S feature.
                        However, this feature is not permanent. If you fail to successfully complete an order, there is an increasing penalty system.
