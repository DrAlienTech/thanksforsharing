                    <h1>Why Choose Us?</h1>
                    <p>The fear that many people have with renting is that the products will be unsatisfactory or be old and overused by previous renters.
                        While we can not guarantee that your order is perfect, we can guarantee a full refund if you

                        Our C2C program is top-notch, with a simple interface that will allow you to share your items with others without stressing over the safety of the item. To ensure this,
                        we have customers pay for the first period upfront, so you are guaranteed that the customer can pay. As with our customer relations, you can

                        The best part? We're all local! We support the Forsyth County community and strive to offer the best experience for our residents. We can not all afford certain things when
                        we need them, and it may be difficult sometimes to find what we need. Through our C2C program, we are promoting entrepreneurship and small businesses that may not have an 
                        open market. Through our guarantees, we want to let you sit back and relax without having to worry about the renting experience.

                    <p>
                        "C2C Verified" means that you have purchased at least USD $500 on our site with your account.
                        After this threshold has been crossed, you will be given access to the C2C feature.
                        However, this feature is not permanent. If you fail to successfully complete an order, there is an increasing penalty system.
