                <h2>How can I get verified?</h2>
                <p>
                    Verification requires $500 to have been spent on this website. Afterwards, you will be able to access the C2C seller tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does payment work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you first purchase something, you pay for the first period upfront, even if you don't use it the entire first period. After one period is over, you are charged again,
                    until the next period ends. This continues for all periods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How do  I create an account?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First you need to click the sign in button. It will have multiple options. You should select the Sign Up button. Then, you need to enter your Username,
                     you email, and a password. If it says that you have created an account, you can click email to sign in. If you then sign in using the Google option, your account will be 
                     switched to a google account. No account information will change. Only the type will change. Also, you will no longer be able to use that email when signing in with email!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What would happen if I were to not accept money?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Any money you make from C2C will directly be sent to your account. If you do not wish to take money, please
                    <a href="mailto:thx4sharing@my-scrap-project.firebaseapp.com" title="thx4sharing@my-scrap-project.firebaseapp.com">email us</a>
                    to further discuss this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What happens if I damage rental property?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you are unsatisfied with your non-C2C order, we are willing to refund your order given reasonable dissatisfaction.
                    <br>
                    If you were to encounter a problem with your C2C order, first contact the seller. If you are not able to work something out, we are willing to refund you completely.
                    <br>

                    How can I myself rent out properties?
                </h2>
